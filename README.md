# AutonomousWorldsGames

There are already quite a few full-chain games in existence. For example, within the StarkNet ecosystem, there is "Loot-Survivor," and within the ETH ecosystem, there is "Skystrife," among others (note: only one game is mentioned for each ecosystem).

In order to collectively build the grand world of AW (Autonomous Worlds), after community discussions, it is now time to create a centralized website for full-chain games. This website will provide features such as game search, guides, tutorials, and more, allowing non-developers to immediately participate in the construction of AW.

Everyone is welcome to participate by submitting pull requests (PRs).
